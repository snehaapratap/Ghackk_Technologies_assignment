### Assignment 1 - Webtoon Content Classifier
This project implements a basic text classification model using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression to categorize webtoon descriptions into genres like romance, action, and fantasy. Using Python and scikit-learn, the project leverages TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features for model training and prediction. The dataset consists of 10 webtoon descriptions labeled with categories, and the models are evaluated using accuracy scores.

With the small dataset provided, both models demonstrated competitive performance, achieving an accuracy of 100% in some cases. The project can be extended by increasing the dataset size, adding more genres, and fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy and generalization.

### Assignment 2 - Sentiment Analysis of User Comments on Manga vs. Manhwa
This project aims to perform a sentiment analysis on user comments discussing the differences between manga and manhwa. Utilizing the TextBlob library, the analysis classifies comments as positive, negative, or neutral based on their polarity scores. The dataset consists of various user comments that highlight different perspectives on manga and manhwa, capturing the enthusiasm and critiques of both art forms. By leveraging a simple rule-based approach, this analysis provides insights into the general sentiment expressed by the users and highlights the aspects that resonate most with the audience.

The results indicate a predominantly positive sentiment, with a significant portion of comments appreciating the creativity and diversity of manga and the modern appeal of manhwa. Additionally, the analysis identifies critical viewpoints, showcasing the balanced discourse surrounding these popular forms of entertainment. This project not only demonstrates the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in understanding public opinion but also serves as a foundation for further exploration of textual data in the realm of manga and manhwa.

### Assignment 3 - Castle Swimmer Chatbot
This project features a basic chatbot developed in Python that provides information about the webtoon Castle Swimmer, specifically focusing on Chapters 83-89. Utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), the chatbot employs simple keyword matching to respond to user queries about the storyline, main characters, and specific chapter details. Users can interact with the chatbot in a conversational manner, asking questions like "What is Castle Swimmer about?" or "Who are the main characters?" The program is designed to be user-friendly, offering concise responses based on the key themes and events within the specified chapters.

The chatbot serves as a foundational project for those interested in natural language processing and chatbot development. It demonstrates essential programming concepts such as string processing, tokenization, and basic artificial intelligence. This project can be further expanded by incorporating advanced NLP techniques, improving the depth of responses, or integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user interaction. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to its development, or use it as a starting point for your own chatbot projects!
